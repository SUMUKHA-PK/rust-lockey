Learning rust creating a new lock server from rust


OKay so currently I have a lot of issues:

1. I have no idea how to think in breadth since it has been so long since I did a project like this.
2. I dont know how to organise files in rust, which means I have to look into every step (thats fine thats what I had to do for go as well)
3. I dont know how to do OOP type programming in Rust as well.
4. Only thing I sort of know is the design that we are goind to implement since Im just copying what has been done.


Lets approach this one by one, Ill start by seeing how I can create two different modules.
That is the client and the server and arrange them in a file format. This should be there in the book.
